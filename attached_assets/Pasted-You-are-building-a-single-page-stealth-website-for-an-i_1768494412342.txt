You are building a single-page stealth website for an investor audience.

Brand: VERICORA  
Theme: white / off-white, calm, premium, editorial-infrastructure.

PRIMARY REFERENCE SITES (YOU MUST ANALYZE AND EXTRACT FROM THESE):
1) https://www.withdavid.ai/
2) https://cofounder.co/

IMPORTANT: Before generating the site, visually analyze these reference websites and extract their layout, typography, spacing, and interaction patterns. Apply those patterns intentionally as described below.

GOAL / OUTCOME
Produce a polished, responsive, production-quality one-page website that feels like a serious infrastructure company.
The site must NOT feel like:
- an LMS
- an EdTech marketing page
- a chatbot demo
- a loud startup landing page

The site SHOULD feel like:
- learning infrastructure
- an operating layer
- a calm, confident, investor-ready system

REFERENCE EXTRACTION INSTRUCTIONS (VERY IMPORTANT)

From https://www.withdavid.ai/, extract and apply:
- Very large editorial serif headlines paired with clean sans-serif body text
- Generous whitespace and calm layout rhythm
- Thin lines and rules used as structural elements (section dividers, subtle vertical rules)
- Narrative scroll behavior where sections feel like chapters
- Polished scroll-based reveals (fade + slight translate, no gimmicks)
- Optional left-side section index or progress indicator that updates on scroll
- Overall “research-grade, thoughtful, serious” tone

From https://cofounder.co/, extract and apply:
- Clean, friendly card layouts for grouped content (soft borders, rounded corners, minimal shadows)
- Slightly humanized UI feel without becoming playful or quirky
- Subtle paper/grid-like background textures used sparingly
- Clear visual grouping of concepts using cards and spacing rather than heavy graphics
- A sense of approachability layered on top of a professional foundation

DO NOT copy illustrations, imagery, or brand-specific visuals from the references.
ONLY extract layout logic, spacing, typography hierarchy, and interaction style.

VISUAL SYSTEM REQUIREMENTS
- Background: warm white or off-white (not pure white)
- Text: near-black primary, muted gray secondary
- Accent color: ONE only (muted teal or soft electric blue)
- Headline font: elegant serif, very large sizes
- Body/UI font: clean modern sans-serif
- Italics may be used sparingly in serif headlines for emphasis
- Lines are the primary graphic language:
  - thin horizontal section dividers
  - occasional vertical rules
  - very subtle grid/graph-paper texture in 1–2 sections only

INTERACTION / SCROLL BEHAVIOR
- Each section should reveal smoothly on scroll (fade + slight Y-translation)
- Stagger reveals for cards and lists
- Motion should feel “museum-grade”: calm, intentional, restrained
- No aggressive parallax, no bouncing, no flashy animations

SITE STRUCTURE (IN ORDER)

5) What It Enables (Agents across domains)  
6) No-Code Builder

COPY (USE EXACTLY — ONLY ADJUST LINE BREAKS FOR DESIGN)

SECTION 1: HERO
Logo text: VERICORA

Headline (choose ONE):
- The operating layer for agentic learning.
- The execution core for governed learning agents.
- Where learning agents become reliable.

Subhead:
Vericora is building an integrity-first platform to design, govern, and run learning agents across real environments, with human oversight built in.

Microline (small):
Built by a team with a decade of experience deploying learning systems in institutions and complex organizations.

CTA:
Primary: Request access  
Secondary: Contact

SECTION 2: PROBLEM
Title:
AI can generate content. Learning requires execution.

Body:
Learning systems fail when the hard parts are treated as an afterthought: context, policy, progress, accountability, and human judgment.
Most AI experiences are impressive in a demo and fragile in deployment.
Vericora exists to make learning agents operational.

SECTION 3: INSIGHT
Title:
What’s missing is not intelligence. It’s an operating layer.

Body:
To scale responsibly, learning agents need a layer that separates what should happen (design), what’s allowed (governance), and what actually happens (execution).
That’s the layer Vericora is building.

SECTION 4: WHAT VERICORA IS
Title:
Vericora

Definition:
An integrity-first execution core for agentic learning systems.

Pillars (display as three blocks separated by thin lines):
Design — Define lessons, journeys, outcomes, and progression.  
Govern — Set policies, constraints, oversight, and auditability.  
Execute — Run agent behavior reliably across learners, cohorts, teams, and programs.

Small line:
Model-agnostic. Delivery-agnostic. Built for institutional deployment.

SECTION 5: WHAT IT ENABLES
Title:
Learning agents that operate across domains.

Body:
Vericora powers structured agent roles that show up wherever learning happens: education, workforce enablement, certification, and public programs.

Cards:
Instruction Agents — Deliver structured learning and guidance with pacing and context.  
Evaluation Agents — Measure readiness, mastery, and progress with consistent criteria.  
Guidance Agents — Support coaching, onboarding, and decision support within guardrails.  
Pathway Agents — Assemble learning journeys and progression logic for roles and outcomes.

Small note:
Not isolated chatbots. Orchestrated systems.

SECTION 6: NO-CODE BUILDER
Title:
Build and deploy without code.

Body:
Vericora includes a no-code builder to define agent behavior, lesson structure, evaluation logic, and guardrails. Teams can author learning flows once and deploy them consistently at scale.

Bullets:
Outcomes & mastery criteria  
Lesson structure & progression  
Policies & constraints  
Feedback & evaluation logic  
Delivery mode (async, live, hybrid)

SECTION 7: PRINCIPLES
Title:
Built on a few non-negotiables.

Bullets:
Integrity by design, not patchwork controls  
Human governance first, not autonomous guesswork  
Context-aware execution, not generic responses  
Separation of concerns: design, govern, execute  
Outcomes over output: mastery, not chatter  
Scale without compromise: trust and velocity together  

SECTION 8: WHO IT’S FOR
Title:
Designed for environments where outcomes matter.

Body:
Vericora is built for organizations deploying AI for learning and capability development in high-accountability contexts, including:

Education systems and institutions  
Enterprise training and enablement  
Workforce development and certification  
Public-sector programs  

SECTION 9: STATUS
Title:
Currently in private development.

Body:
We’re working with a small group of design partners.
We’re intentionally quiet. We’re getting the core right.
