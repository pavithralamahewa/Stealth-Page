We are iterating on the current Vericora single-page website (white/off-white theme) shown in the provided build.

Goal: upgrade from “clean template” to “award-winning” by copying execution-level cues from:
- withdavid.ai: editorial grid, chapter-like scroll rhythm, left-side progress/spine, line-based structure, calm micro-animations
- cofounder.co: refined card styling, slightly softened friendliness, subtle paper/grid textures used sparingly, clear grouping

DO NOT change the core copy. Keep all section order and text the same.
ONLY improve: layout system, typographic rhythm, spacing, line system, card styling, and scroll interactions.

HIGH-IMPACT CHANGES TO IMPLEMENT:

1) GRID + SPACING SYSTEM
- Implement a 12-column layout grid with max width 1200–1280px and consistent gutters.
- Increase vertical section padding significantly (make the page breathe).
- Use a consistent spacing scale across the site.

2) LINE SYSTEM (STRUCTURAL)
- Define a consistent hairline rule style (1px with low opacity).
- Add a subtle left-side “spine” alignment rule that carries through multiple sections.
- Use vertical dividers inside key sections (especially Design/Govern/Execute and the Agents cards grid).
- Add framed “chapter” sections using top/bottom rules to create narrative beats.

3) HERO UPGRADE (ONE SIGNATURE VISUAL)
- Keep the big serif headline.
- Add ONE minimal signature motif to the hero:
  Option A: a “layer stack” diagram (3 translucent planes labeled Design / Govern / Execute) with subtle motion
  Option B: a left-side section index/progress indicator using roman numerals that updates on scroll
Choose one and execute it elegantly.

4) TYPOGRAPHY RHYTHM
- Preserve serif headline + sans body pairing.
- Increase heading sizes in mid-page sections slightly to create stronger hierarchy.
- Improve line-height and measure (keep body text comfortably readable).
- Use italic emphasis sparingly for key phrases, consistent with DavidAI.

5) CTA POLISH
- Improve the primary button style: better padding, subtle radius, refined hover state.
- Make secondary CTA a text link style with understated hover underline.
- Add a tiny arrow icon on primary CTA (subtle).

6) PLATFORM SECTION (Design/Govern/Execute)
- Convert into a framed 3-column module with vertical separators.
- Add small step labels (01, 02, 03) above each.
- Animate columns entering sequentially on scroll.

7) AGENTS SECTION (CARDS)
- Redesign the 4 cards to feel premium:
  - light border
  - more padding
  - subtle corner radius
  - tiny glyph/icon per card (simple dot/line)
  - micro hover: slight lift + border darken
- Keep the text content exactly the same.

8) NO-CODE BUILDER VISUAL
- Replace the current blurred placeholder with a minimal monochrome UI schematic:
  - fake builder canvas
  - blocks/nodes for Outcomes, Lesson structure, Policies, Evaluation, Delivery mode
  - keep it subtle and stealthy (no screenshots)

9) “NON-NEGOTIABLES” SECTION
- Either:
  A) keep dark theme but make it feel intentional: bigger type, clear grid, refined dividers
  OR
  B) keep it light theme and use a framed panel instead
Choose the best option for overall harmony and execute cleanly.

10) SCROLL + REVEAL EFFECTS
- Apply calm scroll reveals across sections: fade + slight translate, staggered children.
- Ensure animations feel premium and consistent (no bounce, no excessive duration).

Deliverables:
- Updated page with improved visual hierarchy and polish
- Consistent grid and spacing
- Strong line-based structure
- Premium card styling
- A hero signature motif
- Refined scroll behavior
