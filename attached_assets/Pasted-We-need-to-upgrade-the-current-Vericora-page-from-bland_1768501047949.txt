We need to upgrade the current Vericora page from bland to produced quickly. Do NOT change copy or section order. Only change visual hierarchy, rhythm, and signature styling.

Implement these exact high-impact changes:

1) OPERATING LAYER SPINE (SIGNATURE SYSTEM)
- Create a fixed/sticky left spine that remains visible through the page.
- Add chapter nodes and labels for each major section:
  I — VERICORA
  II — PROBLEM
  III — INSIGHT
  IV — PLATFORM
  V — AGENTS
  VI — BUILDER
  VII — PRINCIPLES
  VIII — CONTEXTS
  IX — STATUS
- Add an “active segment” on the spine that highlights the current section in the accent color.
- Inactive spine is hairline low-contrast; active spine segment is clearer and in accent.
- Make the spine feel structural, not decorative.

2) HERO: MAKE IT A MOMENT
- Keep headline, but increase hierarchy:
  - Slightly increase headline size and tighten measure (max width).
  - Apply accent color to the italic phrase “agentic learning” at high legibility.
- Place the layer-stack illustration inside a hero-only framed grid field:
  - very subtle dotted/grid texture ONLY in hero
  - a faint shadow plane aligned to grid beneath the stack
  - add small label near illustration: “SYSTEM MODEL” in tiny caps
- Align the hero layout to the spine with clear left margin logic.

3) PLATFORM SECTION (Design/Govern/Execute) MUST FEEL ICONIC
- Add a subtle tinted panel background ONLY for this section (2–4% contrast from page background).
- Turn the 3 columns into a framed module:
  - top rule, bottom rule, vertical dividers
  - add 01/02/03 labels above each column
- Add sequential scroll reveal of the three columns.

4) CARD POLISH (AGENTS + CONTEXT BOXES)
- Upgrade cards to feel premium:
  - more padding
  - lighter border
  - slightly larger radius
  - hover: slight lift + border darkens
  - add tiny glyph per agent card (simple dot/line icon) consistent with the spine node shape

5) TYPO + SPACING RHYTHM
- Increase vertical spacing between major sections to create narrative beats.
- Reduce body text line length for readability.
- Ensure headings clearly stand apart from body.

Deliverable: same content, but with visible contrast, stronger structure, and a memorable signature spine system.
